# Inland-MK47-keyboard-QMK-VIA-setup
I read about this Inland MK47 planck type keyboard, all assembled with per key RGB for only $40 on reddit, available in microcenter in store, and the second day I went there and I got the last one in that store. No doubt a very good deal. Looks like really less and less people are interested in Planck form, with the EZ planck also discontinued, and this keyboard with such great value still out of stock almost everywhere.
The keyboard works right out of the box, but to setup your custom keymap may need some effort and the information you can find online is very limited. So I will share my experience and post the steps and pitfalls I met during the process.

Some useful info about this keyboard:
1. Keycap profile is DSA.
2. The microcontroller is wb32fq95.

# To use VIA online
1. The link from VIA official website doesn't work for this keyboard, won't recognize it. You need to use this link instead: https://via.evove.top/
